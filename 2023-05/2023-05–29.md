## Setting up Git
Wanted to get started with setting up git as writing platform while waiting and riding in the bus.
It went surprisingly easily given I’m only using my phone.
The GitHub sign-up process was easy, my first snag was finding a way to create a directory within a repository.
The mobile web interface and offical iOS client don’t seem to have the ability.
Found an app called WorkingCopy that seems great so far and has the ability to create a folder.

Hoping to organise this daily notes repo like I’ve been using Obsidian at work (been meaning to use).
So top-level is just months with all the daily notes within.
Attachments/images will be a later issue.

## Song of the bus
Love is in the air - Stella Donnelly
Good rendition that brings back feelings of nostalgia.
